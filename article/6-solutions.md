## Solutions

Update your email client whenever a software update is available. Email will continue to play a role for decades but you can reduce the usage drastically as better alternatives to stay in touch exist. 

Use end-to-end encrypted messengers for personal conversations, and at work. [https://www.securemessagingapps.com](https://www.securemessagingapps.com) is a good, independent source of recommendations for that.

If you must stick with emails then use PGP/GPG to verify the identities and encrypt email contents.
